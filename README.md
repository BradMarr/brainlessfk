# BrainLessFK
 Script in a easy to use basic style language then compile to brainfk code.
 ## Utility:
Upon cloning project, you can add scripts to the scripts directory then pass in the path in as an argument. The program will then return the BrainFK code (unless an error occurs) which you could compile using a [BrainFK compiler](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/execute_brainfk_online.php).

To run example script, cd into root directory of project then run `cargo run "./scripts/test.blf"`.
## Commands:
### Command table:
| Command | Description | Argument 1 | Argument 2 | Argument 3 |
| - | - | - | - | - |
| def | defines variable | type | name | value (or length) |
| print | prints value | type | value |
### Example:
```py
def input first_name 6  # defines a string named first_name with a value found in input of length 6 (if name is shorter, _ the remaining time and if it is longer then paraphrase)
def char return 13  # defines a character named return with a value of 13 (ascii of carriage return)

def str money "$504.27"  # defines a string named money with a value of "$504.27"

print str "Hello "  # prints a string with the value of "Hello "
print var first_name  # prints a variable named name
print str ","  # prints a string with the value of ","
print var return  # prints a variable named name

print str "you currently have "  # prints a string with the value of "you currently have "
print var money  # prints a variable named money
print str " in your bank account."  # prints a stromg with the value of " in your bank account."

## BrainFK Logic:
[BrainFK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck) is a minimalist esoteric programming language designed to challenge programmers and showcase the fundamentals of computing. Created in 1993 by Urban MÃ¼ller, it consists of only eight commands: `>`, `<`, `+`, `-`, `[`, `]`, `.`, and `,`. These commands manipulate a simple array of 30,000 memory cells and provide basic looping and input/output functionality. BrainFK programs are often written in a terse, cryptic style, making them both challenging to write and decipher. Despite its simplicity, BrainFK is Turing-complete, meaning it can compute anything that can be computed algorithmically, albeit with considerable effort. It's primarily used for educational purposes, code golfing, and as a mental exercise for programmers.

![array shift visualization](./README_SRC/array_shift.gif)
In this visualization, the squares act as memory cells within the array. The underline is the pointer (or index of array) and the `>` or `<` popping up below are the commands within the code. As you can see when you type `>` it moves the pointer right and when you type `<` it moves the pointer left.

In order to interact with the values of the array `+`, `-`, `.`, and `,` are used. You can also interact with the data using `[` and `]` in order to make loops but I wont be touching on that throughout this project. To begin, the memory cell stores an integer which can be from 0 to 255. The `+` and `-` are using to add and subtract from the memory cell that the pointer is selecting. The `.` then prints the memory cell as a character by converting the integer to it's ASCII value. The `,` takes an input of an ASCII character and converts it to its decimal format.

In this table, it shows the decimal to character conversions using the ASCII conversions. Notice how the first 32 along with the last item are words instead of characters, this is because they arn't visual characters but instead instruct the computer as to how to handle certain information. As you can see this table only goes up to 127, this is due to it being the standard ASCII table. BrainFK allows you to go up to 255 by using the extended ASCII table.

### Example:
The code `+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++.` (33 pluses) would output the character of decimal `33` which equals to `!`. If I then were to append `>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++.` (34 pluses) to the end of it the program would output `!"` and the array of values would look like `[!, "]` in character format or `[33, 34]` in numeric format. In reality though you wouldn't need to store these two values in seperate memory cells so writing `+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++.+.` (33 pluses followed by a period then another plus) would yeild the same output.

## BrainLessFK Logic:
BrainLessFK is a scripting language with BASIC-like syntax, designed to compile into BrainFK. Its compiler is written in Rust, offering a simplified approach to BrainFK programming.
